- 👋 Hi, I’m @sophiastrano , a Computer Science and Bioinformatics & Computational Biology graduate from Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI).
- 👀 I’m interested in career opportunities in software-as-a-service positions related to research biology, with a focus on bioinformatics and general data analysis. I thrive in roles where I'm able to use my interpersonal skills across teams to evaluate and improve workflows, and provide technical solutions to scientifically complex problems. 
- 🌱 I’m well-versed in a variety programming languages and tools like SQL, Java, Python, JavaScript, C#, C++, R, and more, and I'm comfortable with popular web development frameworks like Angular and React.
- 💞️ I’m looking to continue working on a personal website which is not completed in my spare time while I search for a career-focused position!
- 📫 I can be reached at sastrano@wpi.edu or sophiastrano@gmail.com for anyone with project or professional inquiries.
